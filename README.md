## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- SQLite3 (included with Python)

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd order-management-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

The application uses only Python standard library modules, so no additional packages are required for basic functionality.

For a clean installation:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python3 app.py
```

## Configuration

### Email Notifications (SMTP)

To enable email notifications:

1. Open the application
2. Go to **File > Settings**
3. Configure SMTP settings:
   - **SMTP Server**: Your SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - **SMTP Port**: Port number (e.g., `587` for TLS)
   - **SMTP Username**: Your email address
   - **SMTP Password**: Your email password or app-specific password
   - **From Email**: The sender email address

#### Gmail Configuration Example:

For Gmail users, you'll need to:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an app-specific password
3. Use these settings:
   - Server: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: Your Gmail address
   - Password: Your app-specific password

### SMS Notifications

SMS notifications are currently implemented as stubs. To integrate with an actual SMS service:

1. Choose an SMS gateway provider (e.g., Twilio, AWS SNS, Vonage)
2. Obtain API credentials
3. Enable SMS in **File > Settings**
4. Enter your API key
5. Modify `notifications.py` to integrate with your chosen provider

Example integration services:
- **Twilio**: Popular SMS API with good documentation
- **AWS SNS**: Amazon's notification service
- **Vonage (formerly Nexmo)**: SMS and voice API
- **MessageBird**: Global SMS platform

## Module Documentation

### app.py
Main application file containing the GUI implementation using Tkinter and ttk. Includes:
- `OrderManagementApp`: Main application class
- Menu system and toolbar
- Order creation/editing dialogs
- Settings dialog for notifications
- Help and About dialogs

### database.py
Database layer using SQLite for data persistence. Includes:
- `Database`: Main database class with CRUD operations
- Order creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
- Statistics calculation
- Context manager for safe database operations

### validation.py
Shared validation utilities used across all forms. Includes:

## Data Model

### Order Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    customer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    customer_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    customer_phone TEXT,
    item_description TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    total_price REAL NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    ready_at TEXT
)
```

### Order Status Flow

1. **Pending**: Initial state when order is created
2. **Ready**: Order is prepared and customer is notified
3. **Completed**: Order has been picked up/delivered

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation with user-friendly error messages
- Database error handling with rollback
- Notification failure logging
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Email Credentials**: 
   - Credentials are stored in memory only (not persisted)
   - For production use, consider using environment variables or encrypted configuration files
   - Use app-specific passwords instead of main account passwords

2. **Database**:
   - The SQLite database file is stored locally
   - No encryption is applied by default
   - Consider encrypting sensitive data for production use

3. **Input Validation**:
   - All user inputs are validated before database operations
   - SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
   - Email and phone format validation

## Troubleshooting

### Email Notifications Not Working

1. **Check SMTP credentials**: Verify server, port, username, and password
2. **App-specific passwords**: Gmail and some providers require app-specific passwords
3. **Firewall**: Ensure port 587 (or your SMTP port) is not blocked
4. **Check logs**: The application logs notification attempts
5. **Test with a simple email client**: Verify credentials work outside the app

### Database Errors

1. **File permissions**: Ensure write permissions in the application directory
2. **Corrupted database**: Delete `orders.db` to create a fresh database (data will be lost)
3. **Locked database**: Close other instances of the application

### GUI Issues

1. **Theme problems**: The app automatically selects available themes
2. **Display scaling**: Adjust your OS display settings if text appears too small/large
3. **Tkinter not installed**: Install tkinter for your Python distribution

## Development
